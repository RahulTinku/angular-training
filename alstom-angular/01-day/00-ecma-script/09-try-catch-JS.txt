try, catch, throw and finally exist in JavaScript as well
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_errors.asp

The try statement lets you test a block of code for errors.

The catch statement lets you handle the error.

The throw statement lets you create custom errors.

The finally statement lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result.
